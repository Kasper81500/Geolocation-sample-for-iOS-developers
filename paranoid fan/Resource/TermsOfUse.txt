Guidelines of User-Generated Content
Our app enables users to display user-generated content. The PF staff will be actively seeking to remove offensive content which includes (but is not limited to) personal attacks, obscene language, inappropriate images, content sexual in nature and other related topics. Our platform is designed to police this behavior in two ways: (1) enabling the users to "flag" any material that might be offensive and (2) empower the PF staff to actively search all comments, threads, and conversations for content that does not fit our guidelines. Flagged material will be reported to us instantly and we will review it immediately. Violation of our guidelines could cause comment deletion, account suspension or, in some cases, user banning. If you have any questions and/or would like to report a violation please use our flagging system or email us at help@paranoidfan.com.
